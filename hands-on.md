# Q1 - Reading file (Challenge level: basic)

Write the code such that when the `Load` button is clicked, the content of the file
`contact.txt` is added into `div#content`

# Q2 - Reading and parsing file (challenge level: Intermediate)

Create your own `index.html` and `script.js` for this hands-on. Include in `axios.min.js` 
yourself manually (google for 'axios cdn' to find the site to get axios from).

Your goal: when the user clicks on a button, perform the following

1. Read the content of `items.txt` and print it to the console,
2. Add each fruit inside the file into an unordered list inside your `index.html` (that is, display each fruit
as its own bullet point)

Hint: Research the JavaScript 'string split' feature to help you.
